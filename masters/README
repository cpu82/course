University of Cambridge - L41 Advanced Operating Systems
--------------------------------------------------------

This is the material from the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory's
L41: Advanced Operating Systems masters course.  Course development was led
by Robert N.M. Watson, George Neville-Neil, and Graeme Jenkinson, who
gratefully acknowledge the following contributors, without whom the course
could not be taught:

  Ruslan Bukin
  Graeme Jenkinson
  Alex Richardson
  Andrew Turner
  Bjoern A. Zeeb

The course is taught as six 1-hour lectures and five 2-hour labs.  Each lab
session begins with a short "lecturelet" that introduces key concepts for
the lab.  Students will produce three lab reports: a "practice run" based
on Lab 1 (I/O), followed by two assessed lab reports based on Labs 2+3 (IPC)
and Labs 4+5 (TCP).  They will also read selected chapters of the Design and
Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System, and DTrace: Dynamic Tracing
in Oracle Solaris, Mac OS X and FreeBSD, as well as selected research
readings.  Full information on course structure and approach can be found in
the course syllabus: {academic year}/handouts/syllabus.tex.
